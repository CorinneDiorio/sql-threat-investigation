# SQL Threat Investigation Project

This project simulates a basic threat investigation using SQL queries to analyze suspicious employee login behavior in a corporate environment.

## Scenario

As a security analyst, I noticed unusual login activity in a large organization. I used SQL queries to investigate failed logins, regional access, and employee department information by filtering records from mock datasets.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`
- Use of wildcards (`%`) for partial matches
- Filtering by time, department, and geographic location
- Identifying patterns in login behavior for further security investigation

## Files Included

| File                       | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `after_hours_failed_logins.sql` | Retrieves failed logins after working hours       |
| `specific_dates_logins.sql`     | Retrieves logins on specific suspicious dates     |
| `non_mexico_logins.sql`         | Filters for login attempts outside of Mexico      |
| `marketing_employees.sql`       | Lists employees in the Marketing department       |

| `exclude_it_employees.sql`     | Filters for employees not in the IT department    |

## Purpose

This project was created as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program and demonstrates fundamental SQL filtering techniques in the context of security investigations.
